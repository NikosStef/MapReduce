Team Project for the purposes of Big Data course,\n
University of Macedonia, Greece

Processing a dataset, which contains the personal data of the citizens of a city of USA. The goal is to find the citizens, whose data exists more than ones in the dataset. To accomplish the former, Apache Hadoop is used as well the technology Map Reduce. Furthermore, the same problem was solved a number of times, where in each the number of nodes of the cluster was different compared to the others executions. The times that was needed for each execution were written down and printed to a diagram to make comparisons, as well various analytics
